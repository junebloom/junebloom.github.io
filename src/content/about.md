My name is Juniper, of course, and you can refer to me using either she/her or they/them pronouns. I'm a programmer with a particular love for the web and for building lightweight tools that empower people to express themselves.

I believe that cooperation is the most efficient way to make progress and that technology should be free and open. The web platform and the GNU/Linux platform that most of the web runs on are shining examples of what open technology can achieve. A brighter future awaits.

**I'm currently looking for work. Let me know if you're interested in making something wonderful together, you have any tips for me, or you just want to chat!**
